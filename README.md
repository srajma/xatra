Stylistic changes
- [ ] the slider keeps disappearing -- it only appears when I'm scrolling or when I'm fully zoomed out
- [ ] the FixedTextBox only appears when fully zoomed out. It should appear as a fixed element on the screen that stays at the exact same position regardless of where I pan or zoom to.
- [ ] River and Path should have optional parameters color and width, and should affect the display (is the CSS parameter for Path being used anywhere? if not it can be removed)
- [ ] The tooltip that appears upon hovering over a flag should appear at the point of my cursor, and move with my cursor. I thought this is how default Leaflet tooltips appear? Why does it appear at a fixed point in our implementation?
- [ ] map.Text labels should by defaultjust be plain text, without the border box and all that
