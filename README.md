Stylistic changes
- [x] The slider seems to be hidden under the map: I can move it around by clicking where it should be, but can only actually see it visually when I'm zooming out or am fully zoomed out (because that's when the blank space behind the map appears before the tiles load to fill it up). The slider should be a fixed element on the screen *over* the map that stays at the exact same position regardless of where I pan or zoom to.
- [x] the TitleBox only appears when fully zoomed out. It too should appear as a fixed element on the screen *over* the map that stays at the exact same position regardless of where I pan or zoom to.
- [x] custom IDs and classes for styling
- [ ] The tooltip that appears upon hovering over a flag should appear at the point of my cursor, and move with my cursor. I thought this is how default Leaflet tooltips appear? Why does it appear at a fixed point in our implementation?
- [x] map.Text labels should by default just be plain text, without the border box and all that. Its default style could be different maybe "font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #666666"
- [ ] color assignment
- [x] choice of BaseMaps

Libraries
- [ ] copy matchers from old xatra
- [ ] copy maps from old xatra

Development
- [ ] xatra.AdminMap
- [ ] xatra.DataMap
- [ ] possibly calculate and keep simplified geometries
- [ ] loading geojson from file instead of storing it in html; i.e. with a server

Interactive platform
- [ ] DSL
- [ ] type in DSL panel, hit render => gets transmitted to server and parsed into Python, turned into geojson and re-rendered
- [ ] while typing in DSL panel: search, select from AdminMap, preview territories (matchers/gadms/...) on AdminMap
