**GADM administrative boundaries:** see the `download_gadm.py` script. Everything's from [here](https://gadm.org/download_country.html)

**Natural Earth rivers:** https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/10m-rivers-lake-centerlines/ 

**Overpass rivers:** I had downloaded the data earlier with this script: https://github.com/srajma/xatra1/blob/master/xatra/data/data.py but it no longer seems to be working. The data is still there, you can see it on the OpenStreetMap website: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5388381#map=6/31.10/78.27
